     <h1>Chinese tech giant Alibaba has expanded its footprints in Bangladesh after it snapped up online marketplace Daraz yesterday,
         in a development that can be viewed as a game changer for Bangladesh's e-commerce landscape.
         Financial details of the transaction, which includes Daraz's entire business
         in Bangladesh, Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Nepal, were undisclosed. </h1></ul></li>
        <br>

     <h1>The country's e-commerce market is worth about Tk 2,000 crore (about $250 million) and the e-Commerce Association
         of Bangladesh's projects that it will become a billion-dollar industry by 2021.
         The entry of Alibaba, the world's largest online trading platform,
         means the target might be reached before 2021, said e-CAB leaders. </h1></ul></li>
        <br>
      
    <ul><li>
     <h1>“Alibaba's arrival proves that Bangladesh's e-commerce market has huge potential,” 
          said Razib Ahmed, the immediate past president of e-CAB.
          The deal, which comes on the heels of Alibaba's purchase of 20 percent stakes in bKash,
          suggests Bangladesh, a country with a population of more than 160 million and rising internet adoption, 
          has properly piqued the Chinese e-commerce titan's interests.
          About 2 million online purchasers are active in Bangladesh, said market experts. Thanks to the deal, Bangladeshi
          customers will be able to purchase products directly from Alibaba's vast marketplace without
          paying the high shipment charges and customs duty.</h1></ul></li>
